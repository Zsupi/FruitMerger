# FruitMerger

## About

- Homework for game development course at `BUDAPEST UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY AND ECONOMICS`

## Control

- With `A` and `D` you can move the player horizontally.
- With `Space` you can drop a new fruit.

## Goal

- The same fruits are going to merge together  and create a new type of fruit.
- The result-fruit's size will be slightly bigger.
- The order of different fruit types:
  - 🍎 > 🍌 > 🍒 > 🥝 > 🍊 > 🍍 > 🍓
- With each merge, the player earns a point. The higher the fruit's type is in the order, the more points it gives.
- The game ends if a fruit hits the red line for 3 seconds.
- The goal is to earn more points until a fruit hits the maximum height.
